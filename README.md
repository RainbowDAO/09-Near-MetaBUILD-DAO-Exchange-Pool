## 7.What is the Rainbowcity Foundation？


Rainbowcity Foundation is a non-profit foundation initiated and founded by Mr. RainbowKun. Headquartered in Singapore, Asia, it mainly engages in the incubation and investment of the crypto ecosystem. Mr. RainbowKun himself is a loyal fan of Bitcoin and a believer of Satoshi Nakamoto, dedicated to the spread of Satoshi Nakamoto's decentralized ideas. He once put forward the concept of "Bit Civilization" for the first time in the world in July 2021 at the Bitcointalk Forum established by Satoshi Nakamoto , hoping to promote the development of the encryption industry worldwide and practice the true Bitcoin spirit.


Mr. Rainbow Kun believes that in the crypto world, human civilization will have an unprecedented super economy in the future. It is constructed in the form of a decentralized protocol, which puts different and decentralized economic behaviors into a unified economy, and truly becomes the infrastructure of future human civilization in the future. The Rainbow city Foundation was established under this background.

The Rainbowcity Foundation plans to invest in 7 major areas in the next ten years, including Rainbow DeFi, Rainbow Investment, Rainbow Culture, Rainbow Network, Rainbow Industry, Rainbow Education and Rainbow R&D. Strive to become a super economy with a market value of one trillion US dollars. The RainbowDAO Protocol is the first project launched by the Rainbowcity Foundation to build the infrastructure of the DAO ecosystem and contribute our wisdom and strength to the development of the global DAO career.

#  Project Story

## 1.Inspiration



The design of this product is inspired by the requirements by HAPI.ONE in the sponsor challenge: exchange pool model. According to this requirement, we chose to expand further and created the current small system.


## 2.What it does

This DAO exchange pool model system is for various types of DAO organizations to raise funds at a fixed price through this pool. This system is for raising DAO fund and can be applied to various types of DAO organizations. Everyone can use this system to raise the funds they need.


## 3.How we built it



![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RainbowDAO/01-Near-MetaBUILD-RainbowDAO-Factory/main/pic/Logic-diagram/09-Logic-diagram-of-exchange-pool.png)

Introduction to the function steps of the DAO exchange pool model system:

(1) Initialize an exchange pool, set the name of the exchange pool, the address of the token contract to be sold, the address of the token contract to be purchased, the price and number of the tokens to be sold, the amount of funds raised, the start time and end time of mining pool exchange;

(2) The creator of the exchange pool needs to put the tokens to be sold into the exchange pool when setting the number of exchangeable tokens;

(3) The exchange can only be carried out when the mining pool is in active state, otherwise exchange is not allowed. The exchangers can withdraw the purchased tokens when the exchange is over;

⑷ The creator of the exchange pool can withdraw tokens left after the entire exchange ends;

⑸ After the entire exchange ends, if some tokens are not sold, the creator of the exchange pool can withdraw them. During the exchange period, the creator is not allowed to withdraw the corresponding tokens.




## 4.Challenges we ran into

The challenge we encountered in developing this system is how to understand the logic of the product clearly and build application scenarios in different forms.


## 5.Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud that we have completely built the product as the sponsor challenge requires and met the most basic needs of the sponsor.

## 6.What we learned

Through the construction of this system, we got to know more about the different needs of more DAO organizations in actual operation, which is beneficial for us to build a complete DAO infrastructure product.

## 7.What's next for DAO Exchange Pool System ？ 

We will continue to carefully review the logic of the product, conduct internal and external audits of the code and deploy it on the public chain network when the time is right.
